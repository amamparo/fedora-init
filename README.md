# fedora-init

Idempotent setup for a fresh Fedora Workstation (GNOME) install. Tested
against Fedora 44 / GNOME 50; the extensions also work back to GNOME 48.

## Run it

One command on a stock Fedora install — needs only curl and tar, which are
preinstalled:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amamparo/fedora-init/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script fetches the repo tarball into a temp dir itself, so nothing is
left behind. Then **log out and back in** (Wayland can't hot-reload GNOME
Shell).

Re-run a single module by substring: `./install.sh battery` — or without a
checkout, append `-s battery` after `bash` in the one-liner.

Hacking on it? Clone instead:

```sh
sudo dnf install -y git
git clone https://github.com/amamparo/fedora-init.git && cd fedora-init
./install.sh
```

## Modules

### 10-battery

Swaps Fedora's default power stack (`tuned` + `tuned-ppd`) for **TLP**, which
tunes far more hardware knobs out of the box — this is most of the
"Ubuntu-gets-better-battery" gap. Also drops `files/tlp/00-battery.conf` into
`/etc/tlp.d/`:

- PCIe ASPM `powersupersave` + CPU EPP `power` on battery
- ThinkPad charge thresholds **75→80%** for battery longevity
  (`sudo tlp fullcharge` for a one-off 100% before travel)

`powertop` is installed purely as a *measurement* tool (`sudo powertop`) —
TLP already applies equivalent tunings, so no autotune service.

GNOME's power-mode toggle keeps working: **tlp-pd** serves the
power-profiles D-Bus API with TLP as the backend (and TLP still switches
profiles automatically on AC/battery).

### 20-window-snapping

Installs the bundled GNOME Shell extension
`files/gnome/rectangle@amamparo/` (~120 lines, no third-party deps) and one
native keybinding. "Cmd" on a PC keyboard is the **Super** (Windows) key.

| Keys                | Action                                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Super+Alt+←         | snap left, cycling widths 1/2 → 2/3 → 1/3       |
| Super+Alt+→         | snap right, cycling widths 1/2 → 2/3 → 1/3      |
| Super+Alt+↑         | snap top, cycling heights 1/2 → 2/3 → 1/3       |
| Super+Alt+↓         | snap bottom, cycling heights 1/2 → 2/3 → 1/3    |
| Super+Alt+F         | toggle maximize (GNOME native)                  |

GNOME's stock bindings collide with **all four** tiling keys
(`shift-overview-up/down` and `switch-to-workspace-left/right` both default
to Super+Alt+arrows), so the module clears the overview pair and moves
workspace switching to Super+Alt+PageUp/PageDown.

The arrows also snap straight out of a maximized (or fullscreen) window —
Super+Alt+F then Super+Alt+← goes directly to the left half, no need to
un-maximize first.

Maximize fills the work area but keeps the top bar, and Alt+F10 (its stock
binding) still works. Prefer true fullscreen? In
`modules/20-window-snapping.sh`, set `toggle-fullscreen` to
`['<Super><Alt>f']` alone — leave Alt+F10 out — and point the `gsettings
reset` line at `toggle-maximized` (which gives Alt+F10 back to maximize).
Rebind the arrows via the `as` keys in the extension's gschema.

### 30-zsh

Installs zsh + [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) (shallow git clone — all the
official installer does anyway, but a failed download aborts loudly), drops
in `files/zsh/zshrc` (robbyrussell theme, `plugins=(git)` only), and makes
zsh the login shell via `usermod`. A pre-existing `~/.zshrc` that differs is
backed up to `~/.zshrc.pre-fedora-init`.

### 40-multimedia

RPM Fusion (free + nonfree), then swaps stock Fedora's codec-stripped
packages for full builds: `intel-media-driver` (H.264/HEVC hardware decode
on this Intel Lunar Lake ThinkPad — stock has none, which drains battery on
video) and `ffmpeg`. Verify afterwards with `vainfo` (from `libva-utils`).

### 50-brave

Brave browser from its official repo (`files/brave/brave-browser.repo`,
gpg-verified), set as the default browser, and every other browser removed —
Fedora's stock Firefox, plus chromium/epiphany/chrome if present.

### 60-gnome-prefs

The handful of desktop settings that differ from stock: dark mode, battery
percentage, minimize/maximize window buttons, empty dock, touchpad speed,
100% display scale (Fedora defaults to 125%; applied via mutter's D-Bus API
since Displays ▸ Scale isn't a gsettings key — laptop panel only, so run it
undocked or set docked layouts in Settings), and the Ptyxis Moonfly palette
(applied on re-run if Ptyxis hasn't launched yet). Runs as the desktop user
— no sudo.

### 70-no-overview

GNOME opens the Activities overview at every login and has no setting to
turn that off. Installs the second bundled micro-extension,
`files/gnome/no-overview@amamparo/` (~10 lines), which hides the overview
the moment session startup completes, so logins land on the desktop. On
GNOME 50 the overview still *flashes* briefly — the shell now starts its
login animation before extensions load, so hiding it is the best any
extension can do.

### 80-login-keyring

Kills the "login keyring did not get unlocked" prompt that appears after a
fingerprint login. The keyring is encrypted with your *password*, and a
fingerprint match can't stand in for it, so a swipe at the login screen
always leaves the keyring locked — the prompt fires as soon as anything
needs a secret (Brave, Google accounts). The module disables fingerprint
**at the GDM login screen only**, by dropping the `files/gdm/` keyfile and
its lock into `/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/`: GDM logins ask for your password,
which silently unlocks the keyring, and fingerprint keeps working
everywhere else — lock screen, sudo, polkit. Takes effect at the next
login screen; logging out is enough, no reboot needed.

If the prompt instead says your password "no longer matches" the keyring,
that's a different problem (the account password was changed outside PAM) —
fix it in Seahorse (`sudo dnf install seahorse`, then Passwords ▸ Login ▸
right-click ▸ Change Password).

## Adding a module

Drop `modules/NN-name.sh` — modules run in filename order. Conventions:

- `set -euo pipefail`, idempotent — safe to re-run, and guarded (`rpm -q`,
  `cmp -s`) so an unchanged re-run is a fast no-op
- static assets live under `files/<name>/`, referenced via `$REPO_ROOT`
  (exported by `install.sh`; each module also derives its own fallback so it
  can run standalone)
- call `sudo` per command; `install.sh` primes the password once
